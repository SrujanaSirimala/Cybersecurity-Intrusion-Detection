# Cybersecurity-Intrusion-Detection
Intrusion Detection System backed by machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and K Nearest Neighbours

## Project Objective
This project's objective is to create a detection system that can accurately spot cyber-attacks by 
examining user behavior and network traffic patterns. Thus, the system ought to:<br />
➢ Early detection of suspicious activity is key (e.g., irregular packet sizes, high failed login attempts, and 
unusual login times). <br />
➢ Use machine learning models that learn from previous attacks to lessen your reliance on strict rule
based systems. <br />
➢ Strike a balance between usability and accuracy to minimize false positives and ensure that real 
threats are identified.<br />
